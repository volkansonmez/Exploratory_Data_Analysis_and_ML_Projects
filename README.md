## Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_ML_Projects


#### 1- [Anomaly Detection - EDA & ML](https://github.com/volkansonmez/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_ML_Projects/tree/master/Anomaly%20Detection%20Dataset)
This is a timeseries dataset showing hourly temperature values for one year. Kmeans++ is written from scracth for clustering the data and ADTK is used for anomaly detection. The dataset can be obtained at: https://www.kaggle.com/boltzmannbrain/nab 



#### 2- [Audio Dataset - EDA & ML](https://github.com/volkansonmez/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_ML_Projects/tree/master/Audio%20Dataset)
Several laughters in .wav format are analyzed with Librosa and Matplotlib Libraries. Convolutional NN are used to make predictions.
The dataset can be found in the 'laugh' and 'laugh_test' folders. There are 22 laughter files in total. Some sound sincere and some sound fake. The gray scale mel spectogram images of the laughter audio files are trained and tested.



#### 3- [Breast Cancer Dataset - EDA & ML](https://github.com/volkansonmez/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_ML_Projects/tree/master/Breast%20Cancer%20Dataset)
Breast Cancer Dataset is analyzed with Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplot Libraries. Decision Tree & XGBoost models are trained to make a prediction with 95% and 97% accuracy respectively. The dataset can be obtained at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28diagnostic%29



#### 4- [Deep Graph Library (DGL) - ML](https://github.com/volkansonmez/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_ML_Projects/tree/master/DGL%20Library%20Explained)
DGL tutorials are simplified with examples. Deep Graph Library is a great tool to do node classification, edge classification, and graph classification. It has its own tutorial datasets. This notebook has detailed analysis of CoraDataSet and MiniGCDatasets with dgl.nn module. https://www.dgl.ai/  



#### 5- [Framingham Dataset - EDA & ML](https://github.com/volkansonmez/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_ML_Projects/tree/master/Framingham%20Dataset) 
Framingham Dataset is analyzed with Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplot Libraries. KNN, Logistic Regression Classifier, and a One Layer Neural Network are applied to the dataset. Raw framingham.csv dataset is downloaded from Kaggle. 



#### 6- [MNIST Dataset - EDA & ML](https://github.com/volkansonmez/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_ML_Projects/tree/master/MNIST%20Dataset)
Famous MNIST Dataset is analyzed with Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplot Libraries. Pytorch and TF-Keras libraries are used to build models with FCL and CNNs.
The dataset can be downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv , tf.keras.datasets.mnist, or torchvision.datasets.MNIST



#### 7- [Kaggle Movie Dataset - EDA](https://github.com/volkansonmez/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_ML_Projects/tree/master/Movies%20Dataset)
Movie Dataset is analyzed with Pandas and Matplot Libraries.



#### 8- [Time Series Stock Dataset - EDA & ML](https://github.com/volkansonmez/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_ML_Projects/tree/master/Time%20Series%20Stock%20Data)
Stock prices is analyzed with Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplot Libraries. FBProphet, ARIMA, and LSTM models (with Keras TF) are used to make predictions.
The dataset can be obtained at: https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/AAPL/



#### 9- [Transformer - ML](https://github.com/volkansonmez/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_ML_Projects/tree/master/Transformer) 
A Transformer Encoder is coded from scratch with PyTorch and then trained for performing a sentiment analysis on the torch.datasets.IMDB dataset.



#### 10- [Truck Backer Upper - EDA & ML](https://github.com/volkansonmez/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_ML_Projects/tree/master/Truck%20Backer%20Upper%20SSL)
A truck is learning how to park backwards, creating its own training data with emulator and doing its steering with controller.
This notebook is the enhanced version of the copy at the NYU 2020 Deep Learning Class. 



#### 11- [VAE with Yale Database - ML](https://github.com/volkansonmez/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_ML_Projects/tree/master/VAE%20with%20Yale%20Database)
Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) is created and trained it with the Yale Face Database to extract the average facial features of the dataset. This dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/kerneler/starter-yale-face-database-c5f3978b-5
